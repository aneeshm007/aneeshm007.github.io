 <p> Orbital Mechanics involves the force interactions between large 
bodies of mass, governed by the equation
	$$\vec{F} = G\frac{m_1m_2}{|\vec{r}|^3}\vec{r}$$</p>
<br> 
<br>
<p> 
We then applied this equation to a 3 dimensional two body problem. This 
yielded the differential equation system, where the mass of the first body 
is \(m_1\) and the mass of the second body is \(m_2\).
\begin{eqnarray*} 
d&=&\sqrt{(z_2-z_1)^2+(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\\
x_1'&=&v_{x_1}\\
v_{x_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(x_2-x_1)}{d^3}\\
y_1'&=&v_{y_1}\\
v_{y_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(y_2-y_1)}{d^3}\\
z_1'&=&v_{z_1}\\
v_{z_1}'&=&\dfrac{m_2g(z_2-z_1)}{d^3}\\
x_2'&=&v_{x_2}\\
v_{x_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(x_1-x_2)}{d^3}\\
y_2'&=&v_{y_2}\\
v_{y_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(y_1-y_2)}{d^3}\\
z_2'&=&v_{z_1}\\
v_{z_2}'&=&\dfrac{m_1g(z_1-z_2)}{d^3}\\
\end{eqnarray*}
We then used the Runge Kutta 4th order method to numerically solve for 
solutions to the differential equation system using given initial 
conditions. Our code is <a href="orbit2016rk4.txt">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
For our first initial conditions, we had the initial position of body 1 to 
be \(\vec{r_1}=(2,2,0)\) and body 1's initial velocity was 
\(\vec{v_1}=(.2,-.2,0)\). Body 2's initial position and initial velocity 
was \(\vec{r_2}=(0,0,0)\) and \(\vec{v_2}=(-.02,.02,0)\). The mass of 
body 1 was \(m_1=.03\), and the mass of body 2 was \(m_2=3\). With body 1 
in red 
and body 2 in blue, the resulting orbit was:

<p> We then applied our code to some new initial conditions, which were 
the same except for the initial velocity of body 1, which was 
\(\vec{v_1}=(.2,-.2,.2)\). The resulting orbit was:
